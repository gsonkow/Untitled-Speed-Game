==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  Having the numbered sections is helpful, and
   having a link to the slide show is a great idea ~ too bad others didn't\
   do likewise.

   The justification section is also well done, and you seem engaged and
   optimistic about getting a 'finished' product this semester.  As you say,
   tuning the interactions will be challenging and a good learning experience.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Nice work on the presentation.  I like the slides a lot, the color scheme
   is very eye-catching with yellow and black.  Although the information is
   all there, you might consider a graphic or two in addition to your runner
   on the main screen.

   You did a great job on the presentation, very engaging and high energy,
   which keeps the audience connected to what you are saying.  Good work in
   answering questions, too.

   Nice work overall!

=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
