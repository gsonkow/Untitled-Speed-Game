Comments:
---------

problem 4.2 the critical path should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q with duration 32.
   An alternative cricial path can be H -> I -> D -> E -> M -> Q also 32 days.

problem 4.4 you are starting your schedule on Monday when the problem states
   that January 1 is a WEDNESDAY.  You are also not including ALL tasks of
   the project.  This means your project total duration is way short.

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 I like the larger keyboard idea ~ that's a problem for many of
   us.  The confirmation prompt is also a great addition.

Not bad, Gabe!  Keep up the good work....
