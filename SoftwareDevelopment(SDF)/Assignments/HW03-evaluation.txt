Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 47 out of 50 = 94% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

Your answers are very short.  There is a time to be parsimonious, but don't
   be afraid to spend a few more words of explanation.  By the same token,
   you should be a bit more comprehensive with your testing philosophy.  If
   you only test what you know works, you'll miss edge cases and out of
   bounds cases which might break your code.

problem 7-4: the code should CHECK for improper input numbers, but it should
   not really 'fail'; rather it should raise an exception.  THAT's offensive
   programming.

problem 7-5: where would the code send that exception?  What do you mean 'no
   GCD'?

problem 7-7: this is VERY sketchy as to the details of how you'd drive to a
   grocery store.

problem 8-11: the calculation is for two people at a time so for A and B it
   is (5 * 4) / 2 or 10.  You must repeat that for the other two combinations
   and then average those results.  Final score, 14 bugs.


Pretty good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you in my classes over the years, and I
look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world and the
industry.  Keep up the good work!
