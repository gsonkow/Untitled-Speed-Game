Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.6, perhaps a full-on column oriented database is a bit of overkill for
a fairly simple application like a drawing program.  However, you have made
a good case for the database idea.  I'd be interested in seeing how you'd
set the database up!  How would it be organized?  Would each row be a single
drawing or would the rows be shapes that are linked together into drawings?

On 5.8, your drawing is not a state machine; rather it's more of a data flow
diagram.  The problem was asking for you to provide a state machine, which
has states for things like 'digit entered', "E/e entered", "decimal entered",
and so on.  The edges between the states represent the inputs that move the
state of the system along towards the "accept" state.  Think about what you
did in your Theory of Computation class with DFA's.

Good job ~ keep up the good work!!
