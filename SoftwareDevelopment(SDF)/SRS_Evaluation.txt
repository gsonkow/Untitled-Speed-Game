Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Nice work on the introduction section.  The diagram is a good idea to aid
   in explanation of the parts and how they associate.  Nothing else needed
   in this section.

-- Functional Requirements
   This section needs some attention.  For one thing, this is not in either
   of the accepted formats for either waterfall or agile specifications.  It
   needs to be either numbered requirements using the "dot" notation for the
   waterfall style, like:

   5.2.1.2  The Level Selector shall display all currently available levels
            to the player

   or the agile use case specifier style, like:

   9. AS A game player I WANT the Level Selector to display records for the
      levels displayed SO THAT I can select the level at which I want to play.

   You will also need quite a few more requirements, regardless of which way
   they are specified.  An application of this sophistication would have a
   great deal more requirements or user stories.  If using the user story
   method, you'll probably have a few stories that are large, and those will
   need to be broken down into "child stories" so that they are small enough
   to be coded.  For each child story, you will also need several acceptance
   criteria so that you have some way to prove that the story is working.

-- Performance Requirements
   I guess this is enough for this game, although since it is all about the
   speed of the movements, I would think you need at least one or two more
   requirements to specify maximum delay time or some sort of specification
   for the latency of the movements.

-- Environment Requirements
   Good job on the environment section.  Nothing else for me to add, and
   nothing else needed for this section.

=============================================================================
your score:  8% out of 10% which is a B.

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission, including many
more requirements, and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

SECOND EVALUATION:

your score:  8% out of 10% which is a B.

Doesn't look like you made any updates to this document.
